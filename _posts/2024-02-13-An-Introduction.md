# Lotka-Volterra: Acheron devblog
Hi! This is the development blog for [Acheron](https://acheron.atropos.se) where I, [Sebastian](mailto:acheron@atropos.se), will document the process of the making of the MISCON systems we will use at Acheron. This is mostly for our own benefit, but there might be someone out there in the wider larp community that might find this stuff interesting down the line, so here we go!
